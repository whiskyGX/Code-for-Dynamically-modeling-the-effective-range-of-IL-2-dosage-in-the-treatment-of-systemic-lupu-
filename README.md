# Code-for-Dynamically-modeling-the-effective-range-of-IL-2-dosage-in-the-treatment-of-systemic-lupu-

This is the code written in C language for the manuscript "Dynamically modeling the effective range of IL-2 dosage
in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus".

Unzip the code folder and run the "NK model.sln" file with Visual studio or VS code software to open the project. The files "definition.h" and "function_NK.cpp" are the function definitions and equationst. Add a ".CPP" file containing the main functions to run the project.

For example, introduce "definition.h", "function_NK.cpp" and "time_evolve.cpp" into the project to calculate the time evolution for the IL-2 treatment process.
